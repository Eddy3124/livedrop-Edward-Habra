## Why These Two

We selected **Smart Search Suggestions** and **Support Chat Assistant** as our initial AI touchpoints because they directly address ShopLite's core conversion and support efficiency challenges. Smart search suggestions will improve product discovery and reduce bounce rate by helping users find relevant items faster, while the support assistant will decrease support ticket volume and response time by handling common queries about orders and policies. Both capabilities have low-to-medium integration risk, leverage existing data sources (product catalog and FAQ content), and provide clear fallback mechanisms. These touchpoints offer measurable impact on key business metrics while minimizing technical complexity for our first AI implementation sprint.
