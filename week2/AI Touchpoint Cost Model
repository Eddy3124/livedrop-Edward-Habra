# AI Touchpoint Cost Model

## Assumptions
- Model: GPT-4o-mini at $0.15/1K prompt tokens, $0.60/1K completion tokens
- Smart Search Suggestions:
  - Avg tokens in: 800 (product catalog context + query)
  - Avg tokens out: 150 (5-8 suggestions with metadata)
  - Requests/day: 50,000
  - Cache hit rate: 70%
- Support Chat Assistant:
  - Avg tokens in: 1,200 (FAQ content + order data + user question)
  - Avg tokens out: 300 (detailed response with next steps)
  - Requests/day: 1,000
  - Cache hit rate: 30%

## Calculations

### Cost per Action Formula
Cost/action = (tokens_in/1000 × prompt_price) + (tokens_out/1000 × completion_price)

### Smart Search Suggestions
Cost/action = (800/1000 × $0.15) + (150/1000 × $0.60)
Cost/action = $0.12 + $0.09 = **$0.21**

Daily cost = $0.21 × 50,000 × (1 - 0.70) = $0.21 × 50,000 × 0.30 = **$3,150/day**

### Support Chat Assistant
Cost/action = (1,200/1000 × $0.15) + (300/1000 × $0.60)
Cost/action = $0.18 + $0.18 = **$0.36**

Daily cost = $0.36 × 1,000 × (1 - 0.30) = $0.36 × 1,000 × 0.70 = **$252/day**

## Results Summary
- **Smart Search Suggestions**: Cost/action = $0.21, Daily = $3,150
- **Support Chat Assistant**: Cost/action = $0.36, Daily = $252
- **Total Daily Cost**: $3,402
- **Monthly Estimated Cost**: ~$102,060

## Cost Optimization Levers

### If Over Budget:
1. **Reduce search context**: Limit product catalog context to 400 tokens (top categories + recent searches) - could reduce search costs by ~40%
2. **Increase cache hit rates**: Implement smarter caching for search (target 85% hit rate) and support (target 50% hit rate)
3. **Model downgrade**: Switch to Llama 3.1 8B Instruct ($0.05 prompt, $0.20 completion) for 70% cost reduction
4. **Request throttling**: Limit search suggestions to users with >3 characters typed, reduce support to business hours only
5. **Hybrid approach**: Use smaller model for simple queries, GPT-4o-mini for complex cases

### Expected ROI Justification:
- Search improvements target 15% increase in conversion rate
- Support automation could reduce human support costs by $8,000+/month
- Combined monthly value should exceed $102k investment through increased sales and reduced labor costs
